A Javascript utility library to handle go board manipulations in immutable data structures.

This library is entirely frontend agnostic and strives only to represent the rules of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29) and corresponding basic analysis.  Immutability is delivered by [ImmutableJS](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) and other basic javascript manipulations are done with [lodash](https://lodash.com/), this library's namesake.
